The server is hosted on render. If you want to run it locally you need a postgres database and edit the `/server/database/postgresql.js` file how it is said there.\ 
Use `npm run start` from the server directory for the script to start the server.\
`npm run dev -- --open` from the client directory to start the client.\
For FE I used: svelte, sveltekit and SCSS.
